## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2") #If this doesn't work, use the "Packages" tab to install the package.

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
K1 <- Class_Motivation
```

```{r}
K2 <- dplyr::select(K1, 2:6)
```

```{r}
K3 <- na.omit(K2) #This command create a data frame with only those people with no missing values. It "omits" all rows with missing values, also known as a "listwise deletion". EG - It runs down the list deleting rows as it goes.
```

```{r}
K3 <- scale(K3)
```
```{r}
fit <- kmeans(K3, 2)
```

```{r}
fit$cluster
```

```{r}
K4 <- data.frame(K3, fit$cluster)
```

```{r}
names(K4) <- c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "cluster")
```

```{r}
K5 <- tidyr::gather(K4, "week", "motivation", 1:5)
```

```{r}
K6 <- K5 %>% group_by(week, cluster)
K6 <- summarise(K6, avg = mean(motivation))
```
```{r}
K6$week <- as.numeric(K6$week)
```

```{r}
K6$cluster <- as.factor(K6$cluster)
```

```{r}
ggplot(K6, aes(week, avg, colour = cluster)) + geom_line() + xlab("Week") + ylab("Average Motivation")

```

```{r}
K7 <- dplyr::count(K4, cluster)
```
